Hey Hackers, Hustlers, and Hipsters!

On Wednesday, October 5, 2016, MailChimp held their very first “Tech Talk”. Some of our very own PantherHackers were in attendance at this informative event and their experience is something to mention.

Before I get into talking about their adventure in the start-up world, you might be wondering who this successful startup is and what they do. MailChimp is an online marketing platform company. Their services encompass marketing emails, automated messages, and marketing campaigns, to name a few. They provide their clients with detailed reports of their marketing strategies. As one of the prime companies in Atlanta, they are looking for new talent; looking to grow, putting their mark in the technology world that is stemming from the heart of Atlanta. By hosting a “Tech Talk”, they get to shine some light on their company.

Before applicants sell themselves in an interview, they took the first step by introducing themselves to their attendees and talk about what it is their engineers do and why MailChimp is the place to be.

It was an exceptional opportunity for our members to be able to attend this event and getting the chance to be up close and personal with such a lucrative company. For some, the location of MailChimp itself, Ponce City Market, was one of the highlights that they loved. In the words of Executive Committee member, Nishant Sinha, “The venue was really cool. It made me want to intern there.” To be in such a beautiful location, our members were able to witness a free, welcoming, and open atmosphere.

For the event, they had lightening talks that were informative and displayed the vast knowledge and personalities of their employees. “I love it how they made their talk personal to them and the company,” as PantherHacker, Maximillian Naza comments. “I love that the guys at MailChimp were able to provide us with a lot of context.” The topics of their talks ranged from technical aspects such as network security, UI design, and android to useful skills such as the dos and don’ts of interviews and what it is to be a leader. As John Choi puts it, “It will really give you an insight on what you can do with your degree and skills in computer science.”

It’s not every day you get a chance to talk to MailChimp’s engineer team. “It was cool,” former PantherHackers CEO and current developer at MailChimp, Caleb Lewis, says. “I liked the energy. I went around talking to people and they seemed excited. It was obvious spotting the people who really wanted to intern here – they were the ones asking questions.”

From start to finish, from the moment you walk in to the moment you step out of the venue, MailChimp delivers a magnificent night for their guests. For Braxton McLean, “I personally think it was a lot of fun, the speakers seemed to enjoy what they were talking about, and that really shows.” Our members look forward to more events like these from MailChimp!

That’s it for now guys! Always remember to keep on hacking, hustling, and designing!
