Hello Hacker, Hustlers, and Hipsters!

Just over a couple of weekends ago, we had a slew of events that occurred:
Global Game Jam, SwampHacks, and PennApps!  Global Game Jam, held at Aderhold Learning Center, is an event where, like a hackathon, people create a project in order to gain the judge’s appeal. However, the difference here is that the participants make a game! We had many great submissions, but only two made the top cut.

Congratulations to the winners and thank you all for participating! Also, a big thanks to the sponsors Terminus, TripWire, and Rezli for helping out with the event as well. Last but not least, a HUGE round of applause to Jay O’Toole, the organizer of the event.

For PennApps, we had our own Ahmed Hrishit, Harsha Goli and Sri Rajasekaran attend! They definitely made a splash in Pennsylvania. We also attended SwampHacks (thanks to Imanuel Sonubi!) which took place in Florida.

Of course, we wouldn’t have a weekend of a bunch of events without a PH win! Our own Viraj Shah and Josh King attended a hackathon for 24 hours (thanks to Luis for that!) and took home the grand prize! A big round of applause for them! Made us proud guys!
