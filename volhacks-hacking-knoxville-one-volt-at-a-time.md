Hey fellow Hackers!

So VolHacks has just passed us and we had a group of members that attended (small group, but that doesn’t matter!). For those of you who do not know anything about VolHacks, VolHacks 2016 was held up in Knoxville, Tennessee. Hosted by the University of Tennessee (in Knoxville otherwise known as UTK), this particular hackathon was a full 36-hour sleepless event.

According to [their website](https://volhacks.org/>), they had more than 20 sponsors, 36 hours of hacking time (we said that already, we know), 8 partners, 400 spots that they had available for the hackathon, and, apparently, an infinite amount of caffeine (measured in milligrams of course, but that is still pretty uber cool guys!).

Now, the actual location of where all the hacking had commenced was the Min Kao building which is said to be “one of the newest buildings on campus”. As listed on the VolHacks website, it is complete with a great, roomy interior (what any hacker needs), appealing architecture (just in case the hackers planned to look up from their screens), and (of course) that great thing that they all needed: The latest and greatest internet speeds. The Min Kao houses the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science for UTK so it definitely was a primed and proper location for a hackathon of this magnitude: Something to truly look back on.

Also, we would like to recognize some of the PantherHackers who attended VolHacks! Luis, Ahmed, Kenneth, Daniel and Mckenzie have just returned from Knoxville! We hope that they had a great time, learned new things, and even got some cool swag! That’s it for now, until next time Hackers!
