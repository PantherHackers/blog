Hello Hackers, Hustlers, and Hipsters!

It’s been a **busy** couple of weeks for PantherHackers! This past weekend, from November 4th - November 6th, we had **two** hackathons with PH representing: HackATL and UGAHacks! While John Choi covered UGAHacks in a post, which you can check out [here](http://pantherhackers.com/ugahacks-party-school-turned-hacker-school/), PantherHacker members definitely raised the bar at at HackATL with these projects:  

**uSave:**
Team Members: Darien Pourmehr, Nick Wan, Alma Gonzalez, Haroon Qahtan, Riyan Imam
This project is a location-based marketing application that allows students with verified credentials to be able to have the quickest access to promotional deals.

**Stor:**
Team Members: Yassin Alsahlani, Darran Tavin Hall, Snotti Prince St. Cyr
This project is like Craigslist, except we have it delivered by our in-house workers. You buy an item off the app (listings are local) and have it delivered.  

Give these guys a slap on the back if you see them around campus or DM them on Slack and congratulate them on their work at HackATL! That’s all for now guys. As always, _stay hungry_!
