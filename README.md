## PantherHackers Blog
#### Blog posts from PH for PH and the rest of the world :)

Formating of blog posts:

When you first make a blog post make sure to have a JSON header stating your name, title of your blog post, thumbnail, date, tags, and  publication in any order. 
The JSON should also be contained in brackets. An example of this is down below. 

```json
{  
  "author": "Riyan Imam",
  "title": "A Hackathon For Panthers: PantherHacks!",
  "thumbnail": "pantherhacks.jpg",
  "date": "2016-11-05T06:40:35Z",
  "tags": ["all"],
  "published": true
}
```

After you finished setting up your JSON header and entering three dashes (`---`), make sure you add another new line and enter the content of your blog post.

When you start typing your blog post, make sure it is written in Markdown. Here are some links to help you with getting started in Markdown :
