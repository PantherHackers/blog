Hello Hackers, Hustlers, and Hipsters!

This time around, we have the last blog post for the Fall semester of 2016! Of course, the last blog post would cover a party - a “bash” so to speak (Because of the Linux shell and it’s also used to say “party”? Alright, I’ll stop…). Anyways, the “End Of Semester Bash” that was thrown by PantherHackers was definitely a great way to end of such a busy semester for our members. In order to properly split the fun, we designated four rooms: #random, #tabletop, #gaming, and #RPG. The naming convention was used in the spirit of our main communication method with our members, Slack. So let’s go ahead and go into what happened in each room:

**\#tabletop:**
Basically, a board game/ playing cards room. We had a lot of our own members bring in their own games, but as soon as everyone saw “Cards Against Humanity”... Well, you can guess what happened to the other games!

**\#gaming:**
SMASH, SMASH, SMASH! Pretty much, we had Super Smash Bros. running on two different TV screens. We also had two PS4s with one running “Injustice: Gods Among Us” and the other running “Call Of Duty: Black Ops 3”. Admittedly, though, Super Smash Bros. was king.

 **\#RPG (Role-Playing Game):**
 This room started to develop later on at the Bash, but still fun regardless! Here, we had people playing “Ninja” and “Mafia” (super fun game!). While simple in concept, both games are very fun to play with many people.

 **\#random:**
 Well… It was pretty random. Of course, all this activity had to be fueled by some type of nourishment during the Bash, right? Well, GE (General Electric) ordered Fellini’s pizza for us, which fueled the party on for a few more hours onward. Afterward, we had a representative from General Electric speak with us on things that they are working on.

 Now, every party has to have some sort of great challenge, right? Well, boy, did we have ours. At PantherHackers first End Of Semester Bash, we attempted the famous Mannequin Challenge! That’s right, with +20 people, we all attempted to try and stand still enough for us to have one of the greatest and biggest Mannequin Challenges ever made. The process took a few times (about 3 to be exact), but the final outcome is sure to look awesome! Be on the lookout for that on our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/PantherHackers/?fref=ts)!  Now, each party has to end sometime. However, we had one last thing to do before then: To play “Mafia”! Now, it doesn’t sound that big of a deal, but it was. The rest of the remaining Bash-goers gathered around the #RPG room and the game began. It took a good hour or so till the game ended, but it was well worth it! After all, was said and done, it was time to pack up, head home, and call it a day (or study for a test or two).  

 A BIG THANK YOU to each and every single Committee that made this possible: Events, Financial, Marketing, Technical, and Executive! Everyone within those Committees had a role to play and played their roles flawlessly, without skipping a single beat! Also, an even BIGGER THANK YOU for every single PantherHacker out there! This event could not have been possible without your help or your participation. Anyways guys, that will be all for now! Thank you all for a great and grand semester! Good luck on any last tests and you guys will definitely ACE your finals! AS ALWAYS: STAY HUNGRY!
