Welcome to Spring 2017 fellow hackers!

We here at PantherHackers are very happy to have been able to start off this semester with three workshops for our members: GitHub Workshop, LinkedIn Workshop, and API Workshop.

**GitHub Workshop**
Former GSU student, Zach Bloomquist, has returned from the depths of Georgia Tech in order to teach this workshop. If you want to enter the tech industry as a programmer, software engineer, or webdeveloper, it is imperative to know GitHub. Why? Having started as a developerâ€™s collaborative platform, GitHub is now the largest online storage space of collaborative works that exists in the world to make the development with other people a faster more efficient process. It is a real world tool that isn't taught enough in the classroom. Many of those who attended, in the picture above, found the workshop to be very helpful!

**LinkedIn Workshop**

So why a LinkedIn Workshop? We want to help give our members a kickstart because having a LinkedIn is very beneficial in terms of networking and having access to more employment opportunities. With Charbel Aoun present to show everyone how to be an allstar on LinkedIn, attendees received only the best of the best. His passion is unmatched and his knowledge vast. Learning the ins and outs of this Facebook for professionals from him is without a doubt an opportunity missed for those who did not attend. View his LinkedIn profile [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrblaoun1).

**API Workshop**

So what are APIs? They are Application Programming Interface, a set of tools that are used to build an application. With the help of Brian Cabigon and Mo Hijazi, former CEO Caleb Lewis brings to GSU a workshop to show our members just what they are and how to use them. The CURVE was filled with programmers with a thirst to learn and only an hour and a half to quench. To review the basics of what went on at the workshop, you can find Caleb's tutorial on his website at this link [here](http://blog.caleblewis.me/apis/).

Only within the first two weeks have we brought to you three workshops. With about 12 weeks left of the semester, we hope to bring even more for our members, for Georgia State University, for our fellow hackers. Please keep an eye out for our events!

Until next time,
Aimee Vu
