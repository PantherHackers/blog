The weekend of HackGT brought a lot of first-timers into the world of hackathons. PantherHackers was no exception. With more than half of the group new to hackathons, we were ready to tackle this hackathon. 36 hours later, after all of the delicious food and fun and games, our members managed to put together projects that were ready to present.

<strong>GM API Android App
</strong>Team: Imanuel Sonubi, Sri Rajasekaran, Pranathi Venigandla, and Joshua King
Category: GM's Best Auto Hack
"An app that lets you lookup parts for your specific car, price compare between dealers, and schedule a repair all from your phone."

<strong>Alparka
</strong>Team: Shubham Gupte, Cameron McRae, Michael Chung, and Chris Chung
"Basically you text your location to the alparka phone number and it sends back the location of the closest parking lot. To create this program we had to learn and use ruby, twilio, and ngrok. Twilio is the API we used for a SMS bot and Google maps was the other API we used to return the closest parking location"

<strong>Hack'd Schedule
</strong>Team: Braxton McLean, <em>Andrew Sirolly, and Alex Oshin</em>, they're both GT students
"A calendar that's goal was to simplify a calendar and remind system to be better geared for students, like appropriate daily scheduling, semester separation for classes, assignment reminders, and Google Calendar integration to keep it synced beyond the local install. It didn't fully work, the calendar and schedule really didn't want to take Google Calendar's Event system nicely, so they were essentially two separate parts of the app, but it was all of our first hackathons and we learned a lot about the Android development environment!"

<strong>pushandflow
</strong>Team: Abele Amsalu, Jerimiah Lukus, and Wasfi Momen
"The plan is to have a webserver on azure where people can connect to and where devices can send their device information to the hololens. On the web app side, people will simply browse to a url and input simple text strings. These strings will be serialized into json and sent to the unity app. The unity side will take in json, make cubes representing the text string and have a ui element where the text will be displayed."

<strong>Delta SkyMile Services</strong>
Team: Lawrence Chen, Jajuan Brooks, Forrest Wong, and Mitchell Lee
"It's a service that allows Delta Sky Mile members who have earned up a good bit of Sky Mile points may not ever use them all on flights, so we created a way for them to transfer their points to fund their convenient transportation out of the airport to their next location or use it on other services like food, gifts, and much more"

<strong>Intrusion Tracker</strong>
Team: Brian Cabigon, Kevin Aiken, Jason Herrera, and Nishant Sinha
"The project used an Arduino sensed acceleration to detect if a drawer was being opened and log on the users phone. If the drawer was opened outside of a user defined time slot then it would send a push notifications and ask the user to verify that he or she was opening the drawer. The project was thought of as a way to prevent teen drug abuse/stealing."
