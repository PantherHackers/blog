Hello Hackers, Hustlers, and Hipsters!

Just this past weekend, hackGSU had a major showing! HackGSU is put on Georgia State’s very own computer science department. PantherHackers had major hand in helping the event run smoothly (shout out to the financial committee’s Harsha Goli and Sri Rajasekaran!), and we had a ton of PH members participate. Many of our members did amazing and we want to showcase their hard work!

 Team Members: Braxton McLean, Cameron McRae, Lee Klarich Winners Of: Watch Dogs® 2 Best Device Privacy Hack, Best Newbie Team - Presented by Big Nerd Ranch “NoTypePass generates random sentences for the user to type, records data related to each key event, such as when a key is pressed or when it is released, and then finally sends the data to a machine learning algorithm to either train the algorithm to learn how you type or to authenticate a user by categorizing your typing style to a previously learned pattern.”

 Team Members: Forrest Wong, Jajuan Brooks, Jordan Li, Lawrence Chen, James Jackson “Tell Guru how you are feeling. Maybe it’s your first time at a hackathon and you weren’t able to finish your project, but you know you should demo anyways because it is a great experience. But you're also a little scared. Tell Guru. "Hey I don't know if I want to demo. I'm kinda scared." Guru will return an array of quotes pertinent to your situation to help you follow through.”
