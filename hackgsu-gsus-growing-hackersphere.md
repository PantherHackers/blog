Hello Hackers, Hustlers, and Hipsters!

Just this past weekend, hackGSU had a major showing! HackGSU is put on Georgia State’s very own computer science department. PantherHackers had major hand in helping the event run smoothly (shout out to the financial committee’s Harsha Goli and Sri Rajasekaran!), and we had a ton of PH members participate. Many of our members did amazing and we want to showcase their hard work!

 Team Members: Braxton McLean, Cameron McRae, Lee Klarich Winners Of: Watch Dogs® 2 Best Device Privacy Hack, Best Newbie Team - Presented by Big Nerd Ranch “NoTypePass generates random sentences for the user to type, records data related to each key event, such as when a key is pressed or when it is released, and then finally sends the data to a machine learning algorithm to either train the algorithm to learn how you type or to authenticate a user by categorizing your typing style to a previously learned pattern.”

 Team Members: Forrest Wong, Jajuan Brooks, Jordan Li, Lawrence Chen, James Jackson “Tell Guru how you are feeling. Maybe it’s your first time at a hackathon and you weren’t able to finish your project, but you know you should demo anyways because it is a great experience. But you're also a little scared. Tell Guru. "Hey I don't know if I want to demo. I'm kinda scared." Guru will return an array of quotes pertinent to your situation to help you follow through.”

 Team Members: Nathaniel Brown, Mohamed Yassin “Sassnoharass is a web service that functions as an API, receiving a message as its only parameter and returning an integer back to the sender. That number is the likelihood that the message was offensive. We also built a demo to showcase what the API can do.”

 **Speedy**

 Team Members: Caleb Lewis, Daniel Dakev “Speedy facilitates racing between people from all over the world. You sign in telling the app how you want your race set up and the app will pair you up with someone else around the world with the same options. Then it will track you via GPS on your phone to watch where you're going and how fast you're going. There's also a web app that spectators can view races as they happen lives.”

Then, when connected to the Harman Pulse 2, you can visualize the notes being played. This, in a whole is what our app does.”

 **DontWasteFood**

 Team Members: Joel Dsouza “DontWasteFood drops markers on maps and adds a description box. The description includes the pick-up time, address, description. Using the information provided food banks can send volunteers to pick up food and later donate in to the homeless.”
