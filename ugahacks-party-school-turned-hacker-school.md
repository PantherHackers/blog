Greetings fellow Hackers, Hustlers, and Hipsters!

The weekend that just past was amazing for our fellow Hackers, Hustlers, and Hipsters from PantherHackers (Brian Cabigon, Shubham Gupte, Michael Chung, and Kevin Aiken) who went and conquered UGA with amazing projects, and with the fun of cup stacking in between!

**nTime**
**Team Members**: Brian Cabigon, Shubham Gupte, and Braxton Baynard
**Winners of**: Best Overall Hack
The project is based on real-time traffic information where it would wake you depending on the traffic flow, and on the intensity of traffic (all commuters need something like this). The device even goes on to show the weather and temperature of the area you are needing to go.
As Brian said about winning “feels niiiiiiice” can’t say I would disagree!

**Team members**: Michael Chung and Kevin Aiken
The project was based on the idea of rating hackathons that one would potentially attend and you would be able to see and post reviews and other information for fellow Hackers, Hustlers, and Hipsters to read and see if they would be interested in the specific hackathon!
Unfortunately, they were not able to get their projects ready for submission! (You’ll get em’ next time champs!)
When you see these fellow members remember to congratulate them and give em’ a high five!

**Shoutouts**
Big congratulations to Michael Chung and Kevin Aiken who won 1st place in the cup stacking competition sponsored by MLH. Both won bluetooth speakers.

It seems that awesome projects and fun seem to shine from PH and its members! Hope to see more in the upcoming hackathons as well!

That’s all from UGAHacks! As Riyan always says “stay hungry”! Till next time!
